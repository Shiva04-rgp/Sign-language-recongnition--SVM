# Sign-language-recongnition--SVM
Developed a Sign Language Recognition System utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying hand gestures. Implemented computer vision techniques and machine learning models to detect and recognize hand signs in real-time.

--> Captured and pre-processed hand gesture images using OpenCV and MediaPipe.

--> Created a dataset of hand gestures for different sign language alphabets and processed them into numerical features.
--> Engineered a feature extraction pipeline by extracting hand landmarks and converting them into numerical vectors.
--> Trained an SVM model to classify hand gestures with optimized hyperparameters.
--> Integrated real-time prediction with OpenCV for live video-based recognition of sign language.
--> Handled data augmentation and error handling to improve model robustness and accuracy.
--> Saved and loaded the trained SVM model using Pickle for efficient deployment.
